          "He's old",
        ],
        correctIndex: 1,
        explanation:
          "قلبو من دهب (albo min dahab) literally means 'his heart is of gold' — a Lebanese expression praising someone's kindness, not their wealth. دهب = gold refers to character, not riches.",

        explanation:
          "نوّرتو البيت (nawwarto l-bēt) literally means 'you lit up the house' — a warm Lebanese hospitality phrase used to welcome guests. It's figurative, not about actual lights.",
      },

        prompt: "In the doctor dialogue, ضغط means:",
        options: [

        correctIndex: 1,
        explanation:
          "لو (law) + كنت (I was) + بعرف (I know) forms the unreal conditional — 'if I had known (but I didn't)'. لو implies the condition was NOT met, unlike إذا which is neutral. This is essential for expressing regret in Lebanese.",

        explanation:
          "قالتلي (āletli) = she told me, إنها (innha) = that she, مريضة (mrīḍa) = sick. This is reported speech in Lebanese Arabic. The suffix -لي on the verb adds 'to me', and إنّ introduces the reported clause.",

          "This is a past unreal conditional: ما كنت حكيتلو (I wouldn't have told him) + لو ما سألني (if he hadn't asked me). The ما...لو ما pattern creates 'wouldn't have...if not' — a key advanced structure.",
