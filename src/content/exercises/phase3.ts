        correctIndex: 1,
        explanation:
          "لأنو (la'anno) means 'because' in Lebanese Arabic. وكمان (w-kamēn) = and also. بعدين (baʕdēn) = later / afterwards.",

        explanation:
          "الطقس (iṭ-ṭa's) = the weather, حلو (ḥilu) = nice/beautiful, اليوم (il-yōm) = today. Lebanese uses حلو for weather just as it does for people and things. الأكل = the food, الطريق = the road.",

        correctIndex: 1,
        explanation:
          "بدي (baddi) = I want, هيدا (hayda) = this. So بدي هيدا = I want this one. Very common when shopping. قديش هيدا = how much is this, ما بحبو = I don't like it, فرجيني غيرو = show me another.",

        correctIndex: 1,

        ],
        correctIndex: 1,
        explanation:
          "كانت عم بتشتي مبارح = it was raining yesterday. كانت (kēnit) = it was, عم بتشتي = raining (present continuous), مبارح (mbēriḥ) = yesterday. This combines past tense كان with the continuous عم.",

        correctIndex: 1,
        explanation:
          "رخيص (rkhīṣ) means cheap or inexpensive. غالي (ghēli) = expensive, ببلاش (b-balēsh) = free, تنزيلات (tanzīlēt) = sales/discounts. When bargaining in Lebanon, you might say 'كتير غالي، في أرخص؟' (too expensive, is there cheaper?).",
